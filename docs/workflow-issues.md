# Problems with the workflow assignments

## P1: 2 subagent delegation concurrent artificial limit

**Status: FIXED** (commit `bc4126c`) — validated in delta86 logs, model still echoes old behavior on pre-fix repos

**Root Cause:** The orchestrator agent was explicitly told to limit concurrent delegations to 2 in three places:
1. `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md` step 5: `Build delegation tree (≤2 concurrent)`
2. `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md` Delegation Depth Management: `Concurrent delegation limit: Maximum 2 concurrent delegations`
3. `AGENTS.md` coding conventions: `Keep orchestrator delegation-depth ≤2`

This is a prompt-level constraint only — opencode supports parallel Task tool calls natively with no hard limit. The model was obeying the instruction literally, serializing independent tasks unnecessarily.

**Fix:** Removed all three concurrent-limit references. The depth limit (max 2 nesting levels) is preserved since that's about nesting, not parallelism.

**Log validation (delta86):** At `07:22:55Z` the orchestrator still says "I can delegate up to 2 tasks concurrently" — this is expected because delta86 was seeded from the template BEFORE the P1 fix. New repos created from the updated template will not have this constraint.

```
Let me delegate these tasks. I'll start with the high-priority items. I can delegate up to 2 tasks concurrently.
Let me delegate:
1. GitHub expert - to create the GitHub project and import labels
2. Developer - to update the .labels.json file
Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The planner identified these tasks but I should delegate them in a logical order. Let me create a todo list and then delegate.
The planner has identified the setup tasks needed. Let me now delegate the execution to the appropriate specialists. I'll track progress and delegate the key tasks.

# Todos
[ ] Update .labels.json with OS-APOW agent-state labels
[ ] Create GitHub Project for issue tracking
[ ] Import labels to GitHub repository
[ ] Create Phase 0-3 milestones
[ ] Create Phase 1 user story issues
[ ] Report final project-setup status

• Update .labels.json with agent labels Developer Agent
• Create GitHub Project for tracking Github-Expert Agent
Thinking: Now let me delegate the first two high-priority tasks concurrently:
1. Developer to update the .labels.json file with agent-state labels
2. GitHub expert to create the GitHub Project and prepare for label import
Now delegating the high-priority tasks concurrently:
[watchdog] client output idle 76s, server I/O active (write_bytes=115478528) — subagent likely runn
```

## P2: Project creation permission blocked

**Status: FIXED** (commit `7f835c0`)

**Root Cause:** GitHub Projects V2 uses the GraphQL API, which requires the `project` OAuth scope. The workflow permissions block was missing `projects: write`. Additionally, the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot manage Projects V2 at all — only a classic PAT with the `project` scope can.

**Fix:** Added `projects: write` to the orchestrator-agent.yml workflow permissions. The `GH_ORCHESTRATION_AGENT_TOKEN` PAT must also have the `project` scope — verify via PAT settings or `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project`.

```
Thinking: The GitHub Project creation is blocked by permissions. I'll mark it as "completed" in the sense that we've done what we can and documented the limitation.
```

## P3: Mistaken belief project is .NET-based

**Status: OPEN** — needs investigation into the `create-project-structure` dynamic workflow definition and whether it hardcodes .NET assumptions.

```
• Execute create-project-structure Backend-Developer Agent
Now executing **Assignment 3: create-project-structure**. This requires Python adaptation as the assignment is designed for .NET.
```

## P4: /orchestrate-project-setup timeout and completion issues

**Status: FIXED** (commit TBD in `workflow-orchestration-queue-yankee89-b`) — three infrastructure bugs fixed:
1. **Exit code masking**: Idle-killed runs exited 0, making GitHub Actions report "succeeded" despite incomplete work. Now exits 1.
2. **`::warning::` → `::error::`**: Idle kills and hard-ceiling kills are failures — annotated as `::error::` so they surface in the workflow summary.
3. **SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation**: After sending SIGTERM, waits 10s then sends SIGKILL if the process hasn't exited, preventing zombie/hung processes.

Combined with P5's watchdog race-condition fix, the idle kill is now reliable: it won't false-positive during active subagent work (P5), it properly reports failure when it does fire (P4), and it cleans up stuck processes.

### Delta86 analysis (run 23332933790 — succeeded in 26m 14s)

**Timeline (UTC, 2026-03-20):**

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 07:17:19 | opencode starts with `--thinking --print-logs` flags |
| 07:18:16 | Orchestrator matches `project-setup` clause, delegates to Planner Agent |
| 07:19:20–07:22:20 | **Watchdog: "server I/O active (write_bytes=...)" — fix working, no kill** |
| 07:22:25 | ✔ Planner Agent completes (~4m subagent run survived) |
| 07:23:35 | Delegates Developer + Github-Expert concurrently (2 tasks) |
| 07:24:50 | Watchdog: server I/O active |
| 07:24:56 | ✔ Github-Expert: "GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't have permission to create projects" (confirms P2) |
| 07:24:59 | ✔ Developer: labels.json updated |
| 07:25:47 | Delegates Import-labels + Create-milestones concurrently |
| 07:27:27 | ✔ Milestones complete |
| 07:27:27–07:42:51 | **Import-labels subagent STALLS — no server I/O for 15 minutes** |
| 07:42:51 | ⚠ "opencode idle for 15m (no output from client or server); terminating" |
| 07:42:51 | opencode exit code: 143 (SIGTERM) — wrapper returns exit 0 |

**Validated fixes:**
- `--thinking` flag streams thinking blocks during subagent work → prevents idle-output false positives
- `/proc/<pid>/io` monitoring detects server write_bytes changes → proves subagent is alive even when no client output
- 5 of 6 subagent delegations completed successfully without watchdog interference

**Remaining issues:**
1. **Import-labels subagent genuine stall:** For 15m after milestones completed, zero server I/O — the LLM API call or `gh` CLI command within the subagent hung. This is NOT a false-positive watchdog kill; the subagent actually froze.
2. **Exit code masking:** Wrapper returns 0 even when watchdog sends SIGTERM (exit 143). The workflow appears "succeeded" despite incomplete work (import-labels never finished).
3. **Incomplete task list:** Milestones done, labels.json updated, but: import-labels incomplete, Phase 1 issues not created, final status not reported.

### Golf43 analysis (run 23332549552 — still in_progress at 1h+)

Step 13 "Execute orchestrator agent in devcontainer" started at `07:02:12Z` and is still running. Cannot fetch logs from in-progress runs via `gh run view --log`. Either the orchestrator is processing many tasks successfully (fix keeping it alive), or it's stuck but the hard ceiling (90m) hasn't been hit yet.

NM! THIS IS A GOLDEN 100% PERFECTY COMPLETION RIGHT HERE ------> <https://github.com/intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-golf43/actions/runs/23332549552/job/67866999506>



THIS ISTIME OUT DOING NOTHGING -->> <https://github.com/intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-queue-delta86/actions/runs/23332933790/job/67868109799>

## P5: Watchdog race condition causing premature idle-kill during subagent work

**Status: FIXED** (commit `5d89c97` in `workflow-orchestration-queue-yankee89-b`)

**Root Cause:** Race condition in `run_opencode_prompt.sh` watchdog loop. When checking server activity via `/proc/<pid>/io write_bytes`, a single 30-second interval where `write_bytes` didn't change caused `server_io_active` to flip to `false`. The fallback used `server_log_idle` (mtime of `/tmp/opencode-serve.log`), which only reflected server **startup** time — not last activity. So `server_idle` jumped from 0 to the full runtime (~950s), immediately triggering the 15m idle kill even though the server was actively working 30 seconds earlier.

**Evidence from india42 log:**
```
11:44:44 [watchdog] client output idle 886s, server I/O active (write_bytes=146317312) — subagent likely running
11:45:14 Warning: opencode idle for 15m (no output from client or server); terminating
```
Server I/O was confirmed active at 11:44:44. One 30s check later, write_bytes didn't change (normal during LLM API inference pause) → `server_idle` jumped to ~952s → killed.

**Why golf43 succeeded (golden run):** Same code, same template. golf43 ran for 1h 4m and completed all project-setup tasks. It simply never had a 30-second I/O gap at a moment when client output idle exceeded 15m. The bug is timing-dependent — a race condition.

**Fix:** Track `_last_server_io_time` (timestamp of last observed I/O activity) instead of falling back to server log mtime. When `/proc/io` is available but `write_bytes` doesn't change for one interval, compute `server_idle = now - _last_server_io_time` (e.g., 30s) instead of `server_idle = server_log_idle` (e.g., 952s). The process is only killed when server I/O has been truly inactive for a full 15 minutes since the last time it was observed.

**Validation:** Pending — new queue repos created from the updated template will pick up the fix. Use `DEBUG_ORCHESTRATOR=true` repo variable + `DEBUG` keyword in trigger issue body for full watchdog diagnostics including the new `last_io=Ns_ago` field.

Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
Thinking: The user has provided me with the Orchestrator Agent Prompt with the EVENT_DATA section. Let me analyze this according to the branching logic.
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
First, let me identify the key values from the EVENT_DATA:
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Event Name: workflow_run
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Action: completed
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Workflow name: "Pre-build dev container image"
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Branch: main (refs/heads/main)
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Status: completed
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
- Conclusion: success
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
Now let me check the match clause cases:
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
1. First case: type = issues && action = labeled && labels contains "implementation:ready" && title contains "Complete Implementation (Application Plan)"
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - Not a match - this is a workflow_run event, not issues
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
2. Second case: type = issues && action = labeled && labels contains "implementation:ready" && title contains "Epic"
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - Not a match - this is a workflow_run event, not issues
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
3. Third case: type = issues && action = labeled && labels contains "implementation:complete" && title contains "Epic"
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - Not a match - this is a workflow_run event, not issues
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
4. Fourth case: type = issues && action = opened && title contains "orchestrate-dynamic-workflow"
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - Not a match - this is a workflow_run event, not issues
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
5. Fifth case: type = workflow_run && workflow.name = "Pre-build dev container image" && branch = main && status = completed && conclusion = success
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - Let me check:
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - type = workflow_run ✓ (Event Name is workflow_run)
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - workflow.name = "Pre-build dev container image" ✓
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - branch = main ✓ (Ref: refs/heads/main)
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - status = completed ✓
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   - conclusion = success ✓

Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
   This is a MATCH!
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
So I need to execute:
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT

Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
    $workflow_name = project-setup
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
But first, I need to say hello and print the content of the EVENT_DATA section. Then I need to check for test/debug modes - I don't see any "test" or "debug" labels or keywords in the event data.
Fri, 20 Mar 2026 11:30:09 GMT
Let me proceed with the matching clause logic.
